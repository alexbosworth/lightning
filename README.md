## LND Authentication

To connect to an LND node, authentication details are required.

Export credentials via CLI:
[balanceofsatoshis](https://github.com/alexbosworth/balanceofsatoshis):
`npm install -g balanceofsatoshis` and export via `bos credentials --cleartext`

Or export them manually:

Run `base64` on the tls.cert and admin.macaroon files to get the encoded
authentication data to create the LND connection. You can find these files in
the LND directory. (~/.lnd or ~/Library/Application Support/Lnd)

    base64 -w0 ~/.lnd/tls.cert
    base64 -w0 ~/.lnd/data/chain/bitcoin/mainnet/admin.macaroon

You can then use these to interact with your LND node directly:

```node
const {authenticatedLndGrpc} = require('lightning');

const {lnd} = authenticatedLndGrpc({
  cert: 'base64 encoded tls.cert file',
  macaroon: 'base64 encoded admin.macaroon file',
  socket: '127.0.0.1:10009',
});
```

To access unauthenticated methods like the wallet unlocker, use 
`unauthenticatedLndGrpc` instead.

## Debugging

If you encounter any issues connecting and wish to view detailed information
about the underlying grpc calls, you can run Node with these environment
variables set:

    GRPC_VERBOSITY=DEBUG GRPC_TRACE=all node YOURSCRIPTNAME.js
